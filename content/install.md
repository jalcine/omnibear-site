Omnibear is currently only available for Chrome. Get it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omnibear/cjieakdeocmiimmphkfhdfbihhncoocn).

Firefox is supported but not yet available in the Add-on store. If you are comfortable doing a developer install in Firefox, you can get the [source code on Github](https://github.com/keithjgrant/omnibear).

I am working on support in other browsers as well.
